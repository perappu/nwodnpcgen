    "Beast": {
            "Broadback" : "Changelings who are attuned to animals that are renowned for their endurance or stubbornness, such as camels, elephants, horses, mules, goats and the like. Their blessing is Stoic Forbearance: The changeling's player can spend one point of Glamour to add two to all dice pools involving Stamina, for the rest of the scene.",
            "Chimera" : "Homer's Iliad was pretty clear about the creature known as the Chimera: \"A thing of immortal make, not human, lion-fronted and snake behind, a goat in the middle.\" The Chimera kith is not necessarily these constituent parts, but it does represent a changeling who bears parts and limbs from not just one beast but many. A Chimera might result from imprisonment by a chaotic Fae shapeshifter, whose many forms bleed into its Lost captives. The many dreams that seem to comprise a Chimera's flesh grant them the Goblin's Tongue: by spending a Glamour point, the Chimera gains a +3 on any Social rolls made against any kind of hobgoblin in or out of the Hedge. This bonus lasts for one full scene. [Winter Masques -- Page 106]",
            "Cleareyes" : "These Beasts have been granted exemplary senses akin to an animal's. Theirs are the eagle's eyes, the bat's ears, the hound's nose, the raccoon's elegant sense of touch. Cleareyes were kept as lookouts and hunters for their Keepers, charged with discovering a scent for the Hunterhearts to follow or spying an aerial intruder for the Windwings to bring down. However, Cleareyes' keen senses also allowed them to spy a way free of their master. The Cleareyes benefit from Primal Senses: They add +2 to Wits + Composure rolls made to perceive things involving the specific sense that is their hallmark (sight, hearing, touch or taste/smell). In addition, the Cleareyes may spend one Glamour to heighten that sense to truly remarkable levels for a turn -- an eagle-eyed Beast may be able to read a license plate from a mile away, or a fox-woman may be able to catch the scent of her enemy in a crowded nightclub.",
            "Coldscale" : "Kin to reptiles both mundane and mythical, the Coldscale has inherited the nature of sents, lizards, crocodiles, basilisks, wyverns and the like. Coldscales are a phlegmatic kith, given to sullen and brooding anger rather than hasty wrath and prone to cool contentedness rather than exultant joy. They are marked by scales, reptilian eyes and sometimes cool blood. The Coldscale's blessing is Reptilian Blood: the character gains a +1 bonus to any Composure rolls made to resist emotional manipulation and a +2 bonus to any Stamina rolls made to resist damage from biological venoms and poisons.",
            "Coyote" : "It's curious, perhaps, that most of the Beasts reflecting this rare kith seem to bear only one true physical change to their mien, and that is the head. Human features are often entirely gone (with the eyes being the only exception) as the head and face become that of a coyote borne upon human shoulders. Some, of course, manifest different coyote physiology -- a tail, perhaps, or claws with which to dig or strike. Of course, in the folktales of old America, what's significant about Coyote is not how he looks but how he acts. Perhaps the predominant trickster figure in mythology, Coyote is the master of manipulating circumstances to obtain what are often the simplest of desires. He often achieves profound effects through even the simplest of deceptions. Those changelings who reflect his spirit in this kith possess the \"inventiveness\" of truth known as The Trickster's Truth: spending Willpower to gain dice on a Persuasion or Subterfuge roll nets the character +5 instead of the usual +3 bonus. In addition, if the character possesses the Vice of Gluttony, Greed or Lust, the character may then buy Manipulation dots at a reduced experience point rate (new dots x 4). [Winter Masques -- Page 106]",
            "Nix" : "The nix, or nixie, is a river mermaid from Germanic lore. One often possesses the features of a snake and a fish in some amalgamation (fish eyes, snake fangs, skin spotted with reptile scales and shark cartilage). Some legends posit that the nix are truly beautiful, while other tales suggest that the nix are actually quite hideous to behold, but possess golden voices. In the old tales, the nix would confound fishermen with beautiful voices, causing them confusion and leading their boats astray -- often right into the rocks. Such is the power of the Consumptive Voice: by expending one Glamour, the Nix's voice will muddy the thoughts of any who listen to her speak. They don't notice that her voice has changed, but it causes a slowing, almost narcotic effect. For the remainder of the scene, any who hear her voice in casual conversation find their Social rolls hampered by a penalty equal to half the Nix's Wyrd score (round down). This ability can be used only once per day. [Winter Masques -- Page 107]",
            "Hunterheart" : "Often, but not always, those changelings who have something of the predator about them: Wolves, bears, cats, crocodiles, snakes and birds of prey, but also those that embody the hunter in a more conceptual sense. The Hunterheart's blessing is Tooth and Claw: The changeling can inflict lethal damage instead of bashing damage when fighting unarmed.",
            "Riddleseeker" : "Truly unusual among Beasts, Riddleseekers hone their seemingly natural cunning and curiosity to a razor's edge. These changelings exercise an Inquisitive Instinct: The Riddleseeker's player may spend a point of Glamour to add two to all Wits-based dice pools -- other than Wits + Composure perception checks -- for the remainder of the scene. Further, the character gains a free Investigation specialty in \"Riddles.\" The mien of such a changeling usually reflects animals noted for especial wisdom or cunning: Snakes, owls, cats or foxes, for instance. In some cases, however, these Beasts are attuned to more fanciful composite forms, legendary creatures associated with riddles (such as the sphinx) or with great knowledge (like the Iranian Angha).",
            "Roteater" : "Fed on carrion and offal, the Roteater is akin to the vulture and the hyena, the crow and the worm. As a tamed Beast, the Roteater may have followed at the end of his Keeper's war processions, left to feed himself on coes. If wild or ungoverned, he may have fallen into a scavenger's ways simply to survive. The Roteater enjoys the benefits of the Scavenger's Nature. The changeling gains two extra dice to roll when resisting poison or disease; the bonus rises to three dice to resist any poison or disease that stems from something the changeling ingested. The character also benefits from the 9 again rule on perception rolls made to scrounge up useful items from an area.",
            "Runnerswift" : "Changelings who move like the wind, reflecting hares, rabbits, antelopes and the like. The Runnerswift's blessing is Runs Like the Wind: the changeling adds two points to Speed (cumulative with the Fleet of Foot Merit, if the changeling possesses it).",
            "Skitterskulk" : "Changelings who have an affinity with flies, spiders, beetles, centipedes and other creepy crawlies. The Skitterskulk has the Impossible Counteise blessing: Just as an insect, her sense of timing and reactions are second to none. When Dodging, the character triples her Defense Trait rather than doubling it.",
            "Steepscrambler" : "Changelings who are at home in high places, and who are attuned to animals such as monkeys, raccoons, squirrels, some insects and some lizards. The Steepscrambler's blessing is Gifted Climber: She finds climbing easy, no matter how sheer the ascent. The character gains a +3 dice pool bonus when trying to climb any surface, and may attempt to climb even surfaces as slick as wet glass if they will support her weight.",
            "Swimmerskin" : "Changelings who draw affinities with aquatic or amphibious creatures: seals, otters, ducks, salmon, and the like; mermaids, too. The Swimmerskin's blessing is Natural Swimmer. He can hold his breath underwater for thirty minutes, as if he had a Stamina of 7. He can't, however, hold his breath any longer than his Stamina score allows if he's out of water. He may also swim at his full Speed, just as if he were running.",
            "Truefriend" : "These Beasts learned not savagery, but loyalty. They are infused with the nature of animals who have accepted humans as their own. Truefriends are hunting hounds, loyal cats, favored horses, beloved parakeets, animals valued for the companionship they offer. Escaping Faerie was a matter of realizing that whatever fealties they may have been conditioned to show their Keepers, the changelings owed even greater loyalties to the loved ones they'd left behind. The Truefriend can give her allies the Companion's Boon: By spending one Glamour, the character may grant an ally of her choice three additional dice on any roll. Invoking this blessing is a standard action that requires the Truefriend to be able to see her friend and speak so that he may hear her.",
            "Venombite" : "Changelings who have an affinity with poisonous creatures, such as poisonous spiders and insects, or poisonous reptiles. Every Venombite has the Poisonous Bite blessing. Once per scene, the changeling's player may spend a point of Glamour and roll a normal brawling attack (Strength + Brawl - Defense + Armor). The attack causes no damage, but does deliver a lethal poison with a Toxicity equal to the changeling's Wyrd. The victim can't avoid taking the damage with a Stamina + Resolve roll.",
            "Windwing" : "Changelings who are confined to the earth, with their hearts in the skies, drawing affinity with birds, butterflies and bats. The Windwing bears the blessing Gift of the Sky: Although be he can't fly, the air bears him up. A Windwing may spend a point of Glamour to glide in the air for up to one minute per point of Wyrd; he cannot gain altitude without appropriate updrafts, but may move at his normal Speed. In addition, a Windwing takes only one point of bashing damage for every 15 yards fallen, and begins to take lethal damage only if he falls more than 150 yards.",
            "Crypticskin(hb)" : "Changelings who blended in with their surroundings to hide; becoming like chameleons, octopuses, cuttlefishes, and other disguised and camouflaged creatures. The Crypticskin benefit from Protective Coloration, granting them a free stealth specialization. Once per scene the Lost may spend a point of Glamour, shifting their mask and mien to allow them to blend in with the surroundings; granting them the ability to hide most anywhere, even among a crowd a people. This camouflage lasts as long as the player remains still or moves no faster then a few feet a minute; any sudden movements disrupt the illusion of invisibility.",
            "Hardshell(hb)" : "The kin of turtles and crustaceans and all animals known for their rock hard durability. Sometimes slow and wise, sometimes stubborn and unflinching, they all share the trait of being very hard nuts to crack thanks to their ability to Hunker Down. A Hardshell adds 3 dice to defense with the expenditure of a willpower point instead of 2 as well as always having 1/0 natural armor. By spending a single point of Glamour, the Changeling may reflexively convert the damage dealt by a single attack from a bladed weapon into bashing damage. The hardshell may only do this once per scene.",
            "Hedgeurchin(hb)" : "Most changelings lose something when they are dragged through the hedge, but the hedgeurchins took a bit of the hedge themselves. These changelings share qualities with hedgehogs, porcupines, and sea urchins, covering themselves in needle-like spines and barbs. Their dubious blessing is the Hedgehog's Dilemma: once per day as an instant action, the player may spend of a point of Glamour to wreathe the character in spines for the remainder of the scene. Upon being attacked by any kind of brawl attack and certain types of weaponry, the hedgeurchin rolls an attack of Wyrd + their attacker's strength that deals lethal damage. While this power is active however, the hedgeurchin suffers a penalty to all social rolls, with the exception of intimidation, equal to half their Wyrd rounded up, as the spines are only useful at driving away others.",
            "Hiveborn(hb)" : "Changelings who are connected with bees, ants, and other such animals that dwell in great colonies and hives. These Lost have developed a Synergistic Rapport, allowing them to work together with others in concert more efficiently; the Hiveborn add half their wyrd (rounded up) to all teamwork rolls. The player may spend a point of Glamour to ignore penalties for using an untrained skill in teamwork provided that one member of the team has dots in the skill being used, allowing them to always be able to lend a hand.",
            "Qilin(hb)" : "Some lost became as Beasts of myth, imbued with a spark of the divine and the will to punish the wicked. Whether they served as guardians or messengers, the force of their sheer presence lent power to their attacks, but only upon those who were deemed impure or unworthy. While the Qilin is mainly an Eastern kith, it has manifested in the West as Unicorns and other semi-divine beasts. Once per scene with the expenditure of 1 glamour, the Qilin may invoke the Celestial Balance and add their presence to any one brawl or weaponry roll so long as the target's morality score is 4 or below. Conversely, any attack against an individual with a morality score of 8 or above, the Qilin subtracts their Wyrd from the attack."

    "Darkling":
        {
            "Antiquarian" : "Those Darklings who surround themselves with dusty tomes of lore and the artifacts of long-dead lands and peoples. Dusty, quiet and diligent, they hold the Keys to Knowledge: The Antiquarians know where to find lore ancient and modern, and have a near-flawless memory for facts, trivial and not so trivial. Every Antiquarian receives the benefit of the 9 again rule on dice pools including Academics and Investigation. They may also spend a point of Glamour to gain the benefits of the Encyclopedic Knowledge Merit for one question. If the Antiquarian already possesses this Merit, he may spend one Glamour to add three dice to the roll.",
            "Gravewight" : "Cold-skinned Darklings who draw comfort from consorting with the dead, both restless and in repose. The Gravewight possesses the Charnel Sight: The changeling can see the unquiet dead. For one point of Glamour, the changeling can see ghosts for the rest of the scene. The power doesn't extend to any other invisible beings that may or may not be present, and doesn't allow the changeling to touch the ghost or compel it to answer her unless the ghost chooses to allow that.",
            "Illes" : "In Iceland, the Illes (pronounced eels) are troll-like under-folk who linger beneath the surface of the earth and only come out at night. They're said to lure humans away from the surface and into the darkness below where the Illes either breed with the humans or suffocate them (depending on which legend you care to believe). The Illes of the Darklings are similar, to a point, though they needn't be as clearly malevolent. They do tend to be tremendously ugly in the mask and mien. Still, they gain the blessing of their Shadow Beauty: once per day, by spending a Glamour point, the Illes can appear beautiful for one hour (equivalent to the Striking Looks Merit at four dots). This also gives the Illes an additional benefit of +2 Social dice when dealing with characters of the opposite sex. [Winter Masques -- Page 107]",
            "Leechfinger" : "The faeries who steal life from humans, grain by grain, drop by drop, with just a touch. Every Leechfinger knows how to Sap the Vital Spark: With a touch, he can steal the health of another to heal his own injuries. The character needs to touch the target, and the player spends a point of Glamour. The victim takes one point of lethal damage, and the changeling heals one point of lethal or bashing damage, or downgrades one point of aggravated damage to lethal. This blessing can be used once per scene per point of the Darkling's Wyrd.",
            "Lurker" : "The thriving criminal underworld of the Victorian era was mirrored in Arcadia, where devious Gentry criminal masterminds employed gangs of changelings to steal from their rivals. Darting from one shadow to another and either slipping unnoticed into dwellings or snatching valuables from wealthy pockets, lurkers are used to taking what they want without regard for whom it belongs to. This kith was common until the mid-20th century, but eventually the more powerful Gentry hunted down these Gentry masterminds and their changeling thieves. Their blessing is Larcenous Fingers: The lurker gains the benefit of the 9-again rule on all Larceny dice pools, and their nimble fingers mean they never suffer penalties for poor equipment on these rolls. They can also spend 1 Glamour to gain a +2 bonus to any Larceny roll. In addition, lurkers gain the benefit of the 8 again rule on all Stealth dice pools, instead of the 9 again rule other darklings possess.",
            "Lurkglider" : "Raised among the twisted treetops of Arcadian forests or the spires of palaces lost in dark storm clouds, the Lurkgliders are at home watching from the shadows far above. They may be tied to legends of creatures that swooped down to carry off the unwary, or Lurkgliders may have been kept as grotesque sentinels to watch over their Keepers' holdings. A Lurkglider enjoys the blessing of the Gargoyle's Grace: By spending a point of Glamour, the changeling may dive from up to 100 yards without taking any damage whatsoever. In addition, he receives a +2 bonus to all rolls for the puse of keeping his balance on small ledges, outcroppings or other small footholds.",
            "Mirrorskin" : "Darklings who hide in plain sight from the eyes of humankind. Their bones are malleable, their faces like flowing quicksilver. The Mirrorskin's blessing is The Mercurial Visage: He can change the cast of his features to resemble (if not completely mimic) anyone he has met. The player may do this at will, gaining a +3 dice bonus to Wits + Subterfuge disguise attempts. This bonus applies to both mien and Mask.",
            "Moonborn" : "The lunatic children of the moon, those who dance by their mother's pale light. They are sometimes insightful, sometimes foolish, sometimes calm and sometimes wrathful. Their moods wax and wane with the moon, their humours affected by its tides. The Moonborn's blessing is the Lunatic's Kiss: Once in any 24-hour period, the Moonborn may afflict both himself and a person he touches with a derangement. The player must spend a point of Glamour and roll Intelligence + Wyrd, contested by the victim's Resolve + Wyrd (or other Supernatural Tolerance trait). Success gives the Moonborn a mild derangement, and the victim the severe version of the same derangement. An exceptional success means the Moonborn suffers no derangement at all. The madness lasts until the next sunrise in the case of supernatural beings; humans must bear the madness for a lunar month.",
            "Nightsinger" : "The Darklings are not without their music. Darkling music, however, is largely heard without ever catching a glimpse of the musician. Nightsingers compose operas of wolf howls and owl cries, sing banshee songs and play hauntingly devilish tunes on fiddles strung with unwholesome gut. Nightsingers may set aside their instruments and strive to escape for home, but the music stays with them. The Nightsingers enjoy the favor of the Haunting Nocturne: By playing an instrument or singing, they may lull listeners into a hypnotic state. The player spends a point of Glamour and makes a Performance + Wyrd roll; listeners may contest the roll with Composure + Wyrd. Success makes the affected listeners more suggestible; such listeners suffer a -2 penalty to Resolve, Empathy and Subterfuge rolls for the duration of the scene. A Nightsinger also gains a free Performance Specialty.",
            "Palewraith" : "Many Darklings are pallid, but the Palewraiths are colorless to the point of partial translucence. Their flesh is hazy and partly indistinct; some look spectral, others smoky. In some cases, their bones are still visible through their skin. The Palewraiths gained this remarkable trait by being kept so far from natural light that they began to become partly immune to the light. The kith's blessing is Light's Aversion: The character may spend one Glamour to receive +1 to Defense when within sufficient shadows. This bonus also applies against firearms. The blessing's effects last for the duration of the scene, or until the character enters a brightly lit area.",
            "Pishacha" : "In Hindu myth, the Pishachas are demons, gaunt and strange with bulging bloodshot eyes and skin as dark as midnight. Pishachas were said to speak in their own strange language, haunting graveyards and cremation grounds with all the other ghosts. Changelings of the Pishacha kith share the terrifying red eyes and obsidian skin of their folktale analogs, but also have the addition of some manner of odd tongue -- often forked, sometimes barbed or simply over-long. The Pishacha, often associated with madness, can afflict a victim with a Taste of Madness: by spending a point of Glamour and performing a successful touch attack, the changeling licks the exposed flesh of an opponent. The opponent takes a mild derangement of the changeling's choosing (or a severe version if the mild version is already possessed) and suffers from the derangement for the next week. The Pishacha can perform this attack only once per week (i.e., when the last victim's madness finally fades). [Winter Masques -- Page 107]",
            "Razorhand" : "Some Darklings are embodiments of the promise of nighttime violence. They are the sudden slash in the darkest alleys, the gleam of metal under a flickering street lamp. They may come silently, or whistle tuneless little ditties learned in Arcadia. Some even become skilled practitioners of medicine, though their ministrations are often too unnerving for all but the boldest Lost to seek out. A Razorhand may invoke the Ripper's Gift: By spending one Glamour, her hand becomes as a knife's blade for the duration of the scene, allowing her unarmed strikes to inflict +1 lethal damage. In addition, she gains a bonus Melee Specialty (Knives).",
            "Skogsra" : "This Darkling-of-the-wood kith stems from old Swedish and Scandinavian folklore. In these fairy tales, the skogsra are vicious trolls protecting the dark forests, leading travelers astray and either killing them or stealing their goods. Other tales have the skogsra luring wanderers off the trails where they are enslaved, certainly speaking to legends of the True Fae who have done that very thing. The changelings known as the Skogsra are Darklings in appearance, but often possess miens adorned with dark vines and leaves (sometimes growing beneath the surface of the flesh where the veins should be) or have eyes like black pools of water. These forest Darklings are Keepers of the Feral Heart: The changeling must look into the eyes of a single animal (bird or mammal), and by spending a Glamour point, enslaves the beast to be his \"pet\" until the next sunrise or sundown (whichever occurs first). The animal will do whatever it is that the changeling demands, even to its own detriment. The animal must of course be capable of doing the thing asked of it. [Winter Masques -- Page 107]",
            "Tunnelgrub" : "Those of the Darkling faeries who slide and slither through tunnels and sewers and chimneys, the better to do terrible things in the night. The Tunnelgrub has the ability to Slither and Squirm: She slips and slides and wriggles through tight spaces and out of handcuffs and other bonds. The player spends a point of Glamour. The changeling can get through spaces that are only just too narrow for her to get through, spaces that would otherwise leave her completely stuck. The changeling gets to roll Dexterity + Athletics to wriggle out of ropes or handcuffs. If it's a long distance, such as a chimney or a sewage pipe, the player needs to make an extended roll, earning at least three successes, perhaps more, depending on the length of the tunnel. A dramatic failure means that the character is stuck and can't escape on her own or try again using this talent (if the changeling is caught in the middle of a tunnel, this could be disastrous, because she can't get out on her own).",
            "Whisperwisp" : "Spies flourish in the dark, hiding from their false allies and whispering to their true friends. Some have achieved an artful perfection in the trade. Whisperwisps flit from alcove to alcove in the grand halls of the Gentry, worming their way into the confidences of servants and eavesdropping on the masters. The Whisperwisp's blessing is the Turncoat's Tongue: He benefits from the 9 again roll on Empathy and Subterfuge rolls involving conversation or gathering information. The player may also spend one Glamour to whisper a message to anyone within earshot, whether the Darkling can see the target or not. The target hears the message as if the Whisperwisp were standing beside her, murmuring into her ear.",
            "Bogeyman(hb)" : "Changelings whose durance was a literal nightmare from which they couldn't just wake up from becoming warped figures of grisly terror. These lost have learned the dark pathways of fright in the mind, allowing them to invoke Haunting Figments, once per scene by spending 1 Glamour and rolling Intimidation + Wyrd - the subject's Composure, the changeling may awaken the irrational fears that lurk in the mind's shadow. inflicting a -2 penalty to all rolls of an attribute of the changeling's choice. As the envoys of fear themselves, bogeyman have grown comfortable with terror, granting them a +1 bonus to resist fear themselves.",
            "Engaoler(hb)" : "These Darklings had the dubious privilege of being both the ward and the warden, working as incarcerated overseers in the dank prisons of Arcadia. The Engaoler possesses the ability to secure things with Fastidious Bindings. For one point of Glamour, the changeling may either add her Wyrd to the durability of an object or add her Wyrd to the number of successes required to bypass restraints or a locking mechanism. This blessing may only be used once per dot of Wyrd per scene and may only be used for the purpose of making breaking into or out of things more difficult.",
            "Frostfiend(hb)" : "These changelings stem from legends of creatures lurking outside, in the winter storms and blizzards. When a loved one mysteriously went out into the cold and never came back or when a house burst open in a blizzard and the inhabitants froze in their beds, these were the monsters blamed. The Frostfiend’s blessing is Winter’s Kiss: once per scene per point of Wyrd, the changeling may spending a point of Glamour to rapidly freeze a person with a touch (see the World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 157). The victim suffers one point of Lethal damage and loses one dot of Dexterity for a number of minutes equal to the Darkling’s Wyrd.",
            "Hushwight(hb)" : "Some Lost had to learn how to move ever-so-silently through the Arcadian gloom, lest they draw the attention of dangerous predators or worse, wake their Fae masters from dreamless sleep. These Changelings may prefer the quiet of solitude or may revel in as much noise as they can, in defiance of their former Keepers. Either way, they wear the Silent Shroud and receive +1 to all Stealth rolls. For one glamour and a successful Composure + Stealth roll, they may extend a zone of perfect silence in a circle with radius equal to their Wyrd for a number of turns equal to the successes rolled. In this zone, no sound can be heard or made without a successful Wits + Composure roll; others make this roll at a penalty of the Hushwight's Wyrd. This glamour-powered silence automatically fails without a roll needed if any sound louder than normal conversation is made (i.e. shouting for help, slamming a door, or trying to sneak up on someone with a revving chainsaw) or if any attacks are made.",
            "Murkglow(hb)" : "These Changelings followed faint lights in the dark and were led not into safety, but into the clutches of the True Fae. In turn, they became dimly phosphorescent denizens of the night, luring the unwary into deadly circumstances, like the Will-o-wisps of legend. They can use their Luminous Lure to make it more difficult for a solitary target to notice traps and ambushes by spending a point of glamour and making a Subterfuge + Wyrd roll, resisted by a Composure + Wyrd roll. Success levies a -2 penalty to the target's Wits and Composure rolls for the scene. On top of this, the fae are good at recognizing such ambushes themselves and always have a 1 die bonus to Perception rolls to notice purposeful traps This does nothing for inherent, natural dangers.",
            "Panopticon(hb)" : "When taken into the abyssal darkness of the Keeper's realms, these Lost never forgot the light. Growing impossibly wide eyed the Panopticon often find themselves serving as watchmen, sentries, or spies in the service of their Arcadian masters and upon escaping they often find themselves in similar roles thanks to their Ceaseless Vigilance. This grants the changeling the ability to reroll a failed perception roll once per scene with the expenditure of a single Glamour. Furthermore all penalties to the Pantopticon's vision are reduced by half their Wyrd (rounded up).",
            "Sporekin(hb)" : "All Darklings were forced to shun the light, but the Sporekin alone thrived and grew in the black. Stolen through fairy rings by alien mycologists, they tended mushroom gardens and blossomed with the strange, fungal fruit. On top of a 1 die bonus to their rolls to resist the effects of ingested poisons - including alcohol and recreational drugs - the Sporekin can inflict others with the Psilocybic Kiss. By spending 1 glamour and making a successful touch attack, the Sporekin levies a non-stacking 1 die penalty on all of an opponent's actions for scene, as they're haunted by hallucinatory specters. This can be resisted with a Stamina + Resolve roll made at a penalty of the Sporekin's Wyrd."

            "Airtouched" : "The Elementals of wind, cloud, smoke and sky, who can be as healthy as a fresh breeze or as pestilent as the miasma that surrounds the dead. Their blessing is Velocity of the Zephyr: The player can spend one point of Glamour to add the character's Wyrd to her Speed or Initiative (player's choice) for the rest of the scene. This blessing can be invoked once for each Trait per scene.",
            "Apsaras" : "These elementals of cloud and fog are spoken of in Hindu myth. These nymphs, ostensibly female (though the kith doesn't require it), were said to tempt ascetics with their beauty and seductive dances. Those within this kith tend to give off a kind of mist or fog -- sometimes warm, sometimes cool -- that drifts in languid wisps from their oft-unblemished flesh. Many Apsarases are able to stir one's lusty humours through use of the Enthralling Mist: the tongues of water vapor (air and water) that drift from the skin can be made to target an individual. By spending a Glamour point, the Apsaras is able to change this individual's Vice to Lust for the next 24 hours. In addition, the Apsaras can add her Wyrd score to any Manipulation rolls made to affect that individual during that time frame. [Winter Masques -- Page 108]",
            "Ask-wee-da-eed" : "The Abenaki people of the northeastern United States tell stories of a will-of-the-wisp-type creature formed of fickle fire. This creature, the Ask-wee-da-eed, is tied to meteors and comets and is said to bring bad luck and death by its presence. Those of this kith in some way embody the meteoric fire, but are also able to foretell the misfortune of others, in a way, with their Taste of Ill Luck: once per day, by spending a Glamour point, the Abenaki can force another to re-roll a successful roll at -1 die in the hopes that the re-roll fails (the original roll therefore never occurs). The changeling also gains the additional benefit of a +1 bonus on any rolls to activate clauses within the Hearth Contract. [Winter Masques -- Page 108]",
            "Blightbent" : "Some of the most tragic of Elementals, the Blightbent are children of pollution. They were altered by choking smogs, toxic waters, blighted land, diseased forests and chemical fire. Upon their return to the mortal world, the Blightbent are the most comfortable in areas where humanity has tainted the elements in turn. Some Blighbent hate themselves for it. The Blightbent's blessing is the Caustic Caress. Once per day, the changeling may spend one Glamour to inflict a polluted touch on an opponent -- breathing a puff of toxic smog into his face, marking him with acidic fingertips or the like. The player rolls Dexterity + Wyrd - the target's Stamina; the victim takes one point of lethal damage per success. Defense and armor can affect this roll if the target is free to defend himself; otherwise, they do not apply. The Blightbent are also resistant to toxins and poisons of manmade origin, and gains +3 on rolls to resist their effects.",
            "Earthbones" : "Changelings who have the mark of earth and stone: Lumpen Paracelsian Gnomes, sand spirits, dour men of peat and dwarfs made of mountain granite. Their blessing is Terrestrial Might: The Earthbones has shoulders that could bear the world. The player can spend Glamour to add to non-combat Strength-based dice pools, on a one for one basis (one point of Glamour adds one die to one dice pool, two points add two dice to the dice pool and so on).",
            "Di-cang" : "In Buddhist lore, his name means \"Womb of the Earth.\" As one of the bodhisattvas, he was said to calm the suffering of those poor souls lost in the many hells. Born of the earth, one might suggest that Di-cang is a kind of \"jewel elemental,\" for in his hand he usually holds a precious gem that salves the pain of others. The Elementals of this kith tend to possess mostly human features, but have skin or extremities studded with various jewels (some might even have multi-faceted eyes such as rubies, sapphires or emeralds). The Di-Cang can provide others with the Peace of Suffering: by spending a Glamour point, those in the presence of the Di-cang (within 10 yards) suffer no penalties from existing wounds, as they feel no physical pain. This lasts for one scene. In addition, the Di-Cang can purchase Larceny dots at half the normal experience cost, since it was said that the original bodhisattva was able to unlock all the gates of the many hells to gain entrance. [Winter Masques -- Page 108]",
            "Fireheart" : "Elementals marked with fire, heat or electricity. Their blessing is Flickering Acumen: Like a flame, the Fireheart's faculties are bright and constantly on the move. The player can spend points of Glamour to add to Wits-based dice pools, on a one for one basis.",
            "Levinquick" : "Electricity has caught in the heart and blood of these changelings; their flesh is as a lightning rod that calls down the levin bolts into their bodies. Where some Firehearts have had their wits honed by the lightning, the Levinquick are more bodily affected. They are often violent Elementals, quick to strike out at anything that offends them. The Levinquick are gifted with the Fireflaught's Vigor. The player may spend one Glamour to add two points to both Speed and Initiative. The blessing lasts for one turn per dot of the character's Wyrd.",
            "Manikin" : "Changelings who have the character of human-made objects, such as caryatids, mannequins and other, stranger things, such as enchanted beings powered by clockwork or steam or living bodies made of mercury or glass. The Manikins' talent is the Artificer's Enchantment: The Manikin can learn Contracts of Artifice for (new dots x5 experience points) rather than the usual cost. The Manikin also may make untrained Crafts rolls at a -1 die penalty rather than the standard -3 dice.",
            "Metalflesh" : "Changelings who were remade in Arcadia's foundries, the Metalflesh are infused with bronze or copper, gold or silver or brass -- but never pure iron. They are obdurate of mind and body, resistant to any attempts to casually manipulate them. They were prized creations of the Gentry, as decorative as the Metalflesh were resilient. But for those who actually escaped, that same hardiness helped them force their way back through the Thorns to the world of chrome and iron. The Metalflesh may invoke the Forge's Endurance blessing. Once per day, the player may spend one Glamour to add one die to Stamina, Resolve and Composure rolls for the duration of the scene.",
            "Sandharrowed" : "The howling deserts of Faerie produce their own children. The Sandharrowed are embodied with the merciless grace and power of the shifting sands. Those who escape the blasted wastes of Arcadia can make homes anywhere, though they seem happiest in warm cities surrounded by the desert. The Sandharrowed benefit from the blessing of the Enveloping Sands: They gain a +2 bonus to all rolls made to grapple an opponent, or to escape from a grapple.",
            "Snowskin" : "The children of the cold, who can be as powerful as the Arctic ice or as delicate as a snowflake. The Snowmarked's blessing is The Voice of Ice: The changeling can imbue her voice with terrible cold, inspiring terror in those who hear. She is also a master at concealing her own emotions and goals under a cool veneer. The Elemental gains the benefit of the 9 again rule on Intimidation and Subterfuge rolls, and can spend a point of Glamour to re-roll a failed Intimidation roll.",
            "Waterborn" : "Changelings who are imbued with the nature of the waters, soft and brutal, gentle and mighty: Undines and nymphs, man-eating river demons, water babies, ladies of the lake. Their blessing is The Gift of Water: The player can spend one point of Glamour to allow the changeling to breathe underwater and swim at a terrific rate (equal to twice the character's Speed rating) for the rest of the scene. The catch is that the changeling cannot leave the water or breathe air until the power wears off or until he spends another Glamour point to cancel the blessing. The changeling has to hold his breath if he sticks his head out of the water. If the changeling is made to leave the water completely before the scene is over, he begins to drown, automatically taking one point of lethal damage each turn until he is either returned to the water or he dies.",
            "Woodblood" : "The children of plants: Green Men, flower fairies, spirits of mandrake, rose, thorns and all manner of medicinal herbs, fair and foul. The Woodbloods' blessing is the ability to Fade into the Foliage: In any outdoors area where there are plants growing from the earth (in a garden, for example, but not in a concrete yard with a couple of shrubs in pots), the character gains the benefit of the 9 again rule on dice pools involving Stealth and Survival. The player can also spend a point of Glamour to hide in a place where he couldn't normally hide, making a Stealth roll as usual. There has to be a reasonable amount of foliage there. The character couldn't hide using a small patch of moss or a single dandelion, but could use a flowerbed, a lawn or a sapling.",
            "Acidvein(hb)" : "These unlucky Lost were bathed in the caustic acid seas or drenched with the scorching acid rains of Arcadia and emerged with their impurities seared away. They shine and glisten with the volatile chemicals that pulse through their bodies, and simply touching one invites corrosion. Thanks to the Principle of Dissolution they can permanently reduce the durability points of an inanimate object of a size rating equal to or less than their own plus their wyrd that they can touch. This is done by spending glamour on a one to one basis with a limit equal to the Acidvein's Wyrd per scene.",
            "Clayshapen(hb)" : "These Lost never ceased being molded and shaped by Arcadian forces, their forms become soft and malleable like clay or putty. Gifted with the hard earned blessing of Plasticity these changelings recover swiftly from blunt trauma, allowing them to instantly recover from bashing damage equal to their Wyrd once per scene with the expenditure of a single Glamour. Thanks to the pliable nature of their bodies, clayshapen gain a +1 to attempts to escape from a grapple.",
            "Crystalsoul(hb)" : "Imbued with the alien, crystalline landscape of certain parts of Arcadia, these Lost have aspects of quartz and diamond, minerals stacked in geometric shapes or organically grown like coral. They may have spent untold years trapped and immobile in a transparent topaz prison, or mined luminous rock crystal from the depths the earth. Often, they find themselves vibrating in tune with others around them, thanks to their natural Harmonic Resonance. Once per scene, the Lost may spend 1 glamour and make a successful touch attack on an opponent. Through her next turn, she has the same dice bonuses and penalties as the opponent did at the time the glamour was spent - though no total bonus or penalty may exceed her Wyrd. This blessing can also be invoked reflexively in response to a successful brawl attack.",
            "Delicacy(hb)" : "Suffering one of the worst fates, these poor souls were turned into foodstuffs to delight the refined palates of the Gentry. Some were roasted until savory and tender, others melted and recrafted out of spun sugar and candied rose petals, but all were eaten alive over and over again, never allowed to perish fully. They have the dubious blessing called Eat Me, Drink Me. By voluntarily taking one point of bashing damage, they can alleviate a 1 die penalty on a fellow Changeling. The causes of the penalties - wounds, environmental factors, contracts, etc. - still remain, but they do not bother the Changeling for the scene. In addition, a Delicacy never suffers penalties for hunger or thirst, though they may still die from lack of food or water.",
            "Lusterlit(hb)" : "These Changelings were infused with radiant and brilliant light to become shining beacons to hold back the darkness or glittering stars gleaming in the night sky. These incandescent see the world in all its Scintillating Spectra, granting them a +1 bonus to Wits + Composure rolls relating to vision in areas with ample lighting. In addition, the Lusterlit may spend Glamour to shift the spectral sensitivity of their vision, 1 point of Glamour grants access to a single spectrum for the duration of the scene or until they decide to end the effect (gamma ray, x-ray, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, t-ray, microwave, radio). For example, it would cost 2 Glamour to see in both infrared and visible light at the same time and it would cost 8 Glamour to see in all the spectra. The effects of each spectrum are ultimately arbitrated by the ST.",
            "Magmasteeped(hb)" : "Cast into Arcadian volcanoes, rivers of lava, and subterranean lakes of magma, these Changelings were immersed in unforgiving liquid rock and metal. The sweltering heat and crushing pressure were branded into their being, just waiting to erupt. Once per scene, the Changeling may stoke their inner heat for their Wyrd in turns in a display of Molten Eminence by spending a point of Glamour. The unbearable heat deals their Wyrd in bashing damage to anyone with in a radius equal to their wyrd in yards, though those subject to the immense heat may roll stamina + resolve each turn they are exposed and subtract their successes from the damage. The simmering core of the Magmasteeped also grants them a +1 bonus to all brawl rolls.",
            "Newtonian(hb)" : "Elementals formed of stranger things than earth and fire, these Lost have some form of control over some of the building blocks of reality itself. They are able to spend one point of glamour to Invoke the Apple, doubling their speed for a number of turns equal to their Wyrd. Alternatively, they may spend one glamour and roll their Wyrd + Wits + Composure against an opponent's Wyrd + Resolve + Composure to half the opponent's speed for a number of turns equal to their Wyrd. In addition, physical phenomenon come naturally to the Newtonians. This comes as an innate knowledge of where an object or bullet will go, or exactly how far away someone has gone based on time and speed. The storyteller arbitrates when and how this comes into play.",
            "Shroudwrapped(hb)" : "Changelings who became the invisible agents of their Keeper's dominion, orchestrators of gravity and spacetime to mysteries dark matter and energy. The shroudwrapped have learned to reach out with the Hand of the Cosmos. Once per scene the Player may spend a point of Glamour to reach up to 2 yards per dot of Wyrd away, as if the space weren't there, provided there is nobody to witness the event. The blessing also grants the Changeling with an extra die on Larceny rolls.",
            "Wirestreaked(hb)" : "Modern cousins to the Manikin, these Lost bear the digital age's growing presence in Faerie in the form of cyborgs, androids, robots, and mankind's digital fears. Their mind's computational power has been expanded with Alacritous Processing, allowing the Wirestreaked to add to Intelligence-based dice pools by spending Glamour, on a one to one basis. The circuitous nature of their minds reduces the usual -3 penalty on untrained mental skills to only -1."

    "Fairest": 
        {
            "Bright One" : "Changelings who came from light; will-o'-the-wisps, bright elves, White Ladies and other beings of light and fire and ice from all over the world. Their blessing is Goblin Illumination: The player can, at will, illuminate an area the size of a smallish room (about 15' x 15' x 10' high) with a soft, pale light for the rest of the scene. Although the light centers on the changeling's left hand, it doesn't have the changeling as its source, seemingly coming from the air itself. The light doesn't move. If the changeling leaves the radius of the light, he leaves it behind. With the expenditure of a Glamour point, the light becomes painfully intense; anyone trying to target the Bright One treats him as partially concealed and suffers a -2 dice penalty (-1 die if the attacker is wearing sunglasses).",
            "Dancer" : "Those among the Fairest blessed of particular agility and grace, for whom motion is itself beauty and art. Whether entertainer, courtesan, artist or murderer, the Dancer is happiest when moving to the sound of her inner rhythm. The Dancer's blessing is Fae Grace: She benefits from the 9 again rule on any Expression or Socialize rolls involving agility (such as juggling or dancing in a performance or social setting), and always adds one to her Dodge total when dodging attacks.",
            "Draconic" : "Changelings who bear within them the blood of dragons or other Great Beasts of Faerie, including celestial bureaucrats and tithe-payers to Satan alike. Haughty and possessing a robust physicality, the Draconic Fairest have the secret of the Dragon's Talon: a Draconic changeling gains an extra die on Brawl rolls, striking with the power of a chimera's claw or manticore's sting. His player can also spend one point of Glamour to re-take one failed Brawl roll, once per scene.",
            "Flamesiren" : "These burning Fairest represents the entrancement of flame -- when people stare at a flickering candle or gaze into a crackling bonfire, the force that holds their attention is the essence of the Flamesiren's appeal. It's the beauty of danger and destruction, together in one sinuous, lambent package. The Flamesiren may invoke the blessing of Burning Hypnotism: Once per scene, the player may spend one Glamour to surround the Flamesiren with a blazing flame-like aura. Anyone looking at the Flamesiren must make a successful Resolve + Composure roll, or suffer a two-dice penalty to all actions until the character decides to douse the aura or the scene ends, thanks to the distraction.",
            "Flowering" : "Flowers blossom on bare earth where these changelings have stood (although they take months to appear in the human world rather than seconds, as they did in Faerie). Their skin is soft like the petal of a rose or a chrysanthemum and bright with a bloom of health. The Flowering Fairest has a Seductive Fragrance: her skin, hair and breath carries the aroma of unknown blossoms from places unseen, the promise of pleasures unknown. Her bouquet seduces and lulls in equal measure. She gains the benefit of the 9 again rule on dice pools including Persuasion, Socialize and Subterfuge.",
            "Gandharva" : "In Hindu lore, these often androgynous messengers of the gods were beautiful and strange, sometimes having animal or plant parts as part of their heavenly flesh. The changelings of this kith are similar, often pale or golden-fleshed, equally androgynous (leaning toward the feminine, even when male). They are, just as their mythic counterts, said to be beautiful speakers and musicians. They speak and sing with Heavenly Articulation: by spending a point of Glamour, the changeling gains an exceptional success on an Expression or Persuasion roll at three successes, not the normal five. This lasts for the remainder of the scene. [Winter Masques -- Page 108]",
            "Incubus / Succubus" : "Whether the Jewish Lilitu or the Arab um al duwayce, the core idea of the succubus or incubus is the same: A demon or spirit possessed of beauty that is used for malevolent puses. Their beauty is darkened inevitably by something that happened to them in Faerie, and this hangs upon them in some way that colors their splendor with hints of the diabolical (blood-red eyes, bat wings, black nails, teeth filed to points or other demonic characteristics). These changelings are temptresses, creatures who are imprisoned by lust but can also wield it like a weapon. The Succubus and Incubus gain advantages from Vice to Vice: if another character has the same Vice as the Succubus, the Succubus gains a +1 to all Social rolls when dealing with that target. If the Vice shared is Lust, then that bonus is doubled, becoming +2. The Succubus and Incubus also gain the Striking Looks Merit for free at two dots; if the Succubus and Incubus already possess the two-dot version, then it increases to the full four-dot version. [Winter Masques -- Page 109]",
            "Muse" : "Their beauty inspires the arts. Whether a Rubenesque beauty, a sedate and delicate daughter of the Heavenly Ministry, a grotesquely beautiful masquer garbed in yellow tatters, or a Dark Lady who drives her beloved to destruction, the Muse inspires the creation of things of beauty and horror and love and hate and fear. The growth of confidence can precipitate a headlong rush to doom, and the Muse knows how to make it happen. The Muse's talent is The Tyranny of Ideas: The changeling's presence can give a human the confidence and talent to do things that he otherwise would not be able to do. For every point of Glamour the changeling spends, the human subject (and it must be human; it can't be another changeling or another supernatural being) gains +2 on one dice pool involving Expression, Persuasion, Socialize, or Subterfuge.",
            "Playmate" : "A changeling taken by a Keeper who just wants someone to play with might become a member of the Playmate kith. Their blessing is The Circle of Friends: The changeling gains a +2 to any teamwork roll when he is the primary actor. When he is a secondary actor, he can forgo making a roll to add dice to the primary actor's roll and instead grant the primary actor 9-again (or 8-again, if the roll already has the 9-again benefit).",
            "Polychromatic" : "They are the sons and daughters of the rainbow, fae who are living embodiments of color itself. Their hair and eyes flash all number of vibrant colors, sometimes shifting to match the Fairest's temper. In a world of leaden skies and rain-slick gray concrete, the Polychromatics are a form of beauty that can never be dimmed. These Fairest enjoy the benefits of the Prismatic Heart: The character can change her mood as if moving from color to color. By spending one Glamour point as a reflexive action, the character may add two dice to any rolls made to resist emotional manipulation for the duration of the scene. In addition, all Empathy rolls made against the Polychromatic suffer a penalty of one die, as her prismatic moods are difficult to read.",
            "Shadowsoul" : "The antithesis of the Bright Ones, these fae are the most beautiful chosen of the nigh. Their beauty comes from the darkness they swathe themselves in rather than the light they radiate. They were the favored concubines, adornments and hand-maidens to nocturnal Keepers, and are distant cousins to the Darklings. The Shadowsoul's blessing is the Unnatural Chill: The player gains a bonus to Intimidation rolls equal to her Wyrd, and receives the benefit of the 9 again rule to Subterfuge rolls. In addition, she may purchase Contracts of Darkness as affinity Contracts.",
            "Telluric" : "Those who walk the skybridges in the vaults of Faerie heaven, the stars in their hair and comets in their eyes. Tellurics are Fairest imbued with the essence and spirit of celestial bodies. They shine with empyrean light, have hair like a starry nebula, or are marked with the signs of a specific planet -- the red skin and fiery temper of Mars, the quicksilver wit and quicksilver hair of Mercury, the pale beauty of the moon. Telluric Fairest are guided by the Music of the Spheres: Tellurics have an absolute knowledge of exactly what time it is as measured locally, even if they've spent the last day unconscious in a barren room. They can count down ticking seconds as accurately as a stopwatch, which gives them a +3 bonus to any actions that might require precise timing (such as disarming a time bomb or attempting to drive across town while hitting all green lights). In addition, Tellurics gain the free Specialties of Astronomy and Astrology to Academics and Occult, respectively.",
            "Treasured" : "Far more than any other Fairest, the Treasured were treated as nothing more than prized objects for display. They spent their durance in golden cages or atop cold stone pedestals, with no greater hope than to please the eye of a passing Gentry. Treasured are jeweled, gilded, alabaster, like Michelangelo's David given the faintest hint of color or a figure that has stepped away from Alma-Tadema's The Roses of Heliogabalus. Countless hours upon a pedestal have given the Treasured the blessing of Alabaster Fortitude: Once per scene, the player may spend one Glamour to retake any one failed Stamina, Resolve or Composure roll. The only exception is a roll made to avoid gaining a derangement through Clarity loss.",
            "Weisse Frau" : "The Weisse Frau (\"White Lady\") in German lore is a beautiful matron said to protect children. Wearing all white, she is thought to be benevolent and sad (compared quite often to the Mexican La Llorona, the \"weeping woman\" who waits by the river-side crying for the children she has lost). It's said that a kiss from the Weisse Frau confers protection, and this is true for those of the kith. With the Kiss of Life, the character can, once per chapter, kiss another and spend a point of Glamour. In doing so, she grants that person two points of armor that is invisible and without substance, but works to protect the individual just the same. This armor does not stack with mundane or magical armor. Perhaps more importantly, in kissing a child (under the age of 13), this armor increases from two to three. [Winter Masques -- Page 109]",
            "Apollonian(hb)" : "Those Changelings who come to embody the physical ideal of perfection rather than the aesthetic, like the heroic athletes of legend. Often fiercely competitive, they excel at all manner of physical contests, whether it's cleaving a block of stone in two with a single blow, running for days on end without so much as losing their breath, or skittering catlike through the most deadly obstacles. To ensure excellence, Apollonians rely on Arete, which gives an extra die to all Athletics rolls. For 1 glamour, they can also reroll any failed Athletics roll. The second roll must be accepted.",
            "Courtesan(hb)" : "Exemplars of courtly upbringing and social standing, these changelings were kept as companions by the True Fae. Although never treated with equal status, these Lost maintained a position above their follow changelings provided they could navigate the social mores and protocol of their faerie lords and ladies. Due to their experience with faerie high society, Courtesans have developed a sense of Impeccable Etiquette which allows them to, once per scene, reroll the failed dice of any social roll dealing with manners and social protocol by spending a point of Glamour. Additionally, their social graces allow them to purchase the Contacts merit for half price.",
            "Dionysian(hb)" : "Hedonistic and untamable, these changelings nearly lost themselves to an endless cycle of debauchery and depravity. In tune with their darkest passions, they know well the Rites of Bacchanalia, benefitting from the nine-again rule to harvest Glamour in situations aligned with their Vice. In addition, a Dionysian never takes penalties from being disheveled or unkempt in Presence or Manipulation rolls.",
            "Gladiator(hb)" : "When thrown into the arenas of Faerie before an audience of Lords and Ladies, the Gladiators learned not brute savagery but elegant style to take down the foes and please their fickle audience lest they face their jeers and their Keeper's displeasure. To keep the spectators pleased, Gladiators had to learn to strike with Fantastic Flourish, allowing them to once per scene spend Glamour in place of taking negative combat aspects on a one to one basis (Mirrors p74).",
            "Gorgon(hb)" : "This Fairest was held in her durance by a highly envious and miserly Master, who refused to let anyone else, even the lowliest changeling servant, look upon her beauty. This translated to the fact that her perfection is intimidating to look at, like even glimpsing her is a crime. The Gorgon’s blessing is Terrifying Gaze: the player gains a bonus to Intimidation rolls equal to her Wyrd and all social rolls made against her do not have the 10-again rule. In addition, those who wish to directly meet her gaze must beat her Intimidation + Wyrd with a Composure + Resolve check or spend a point of Willpwer. Drawback: Being supernaturally intimidating doesn’t help with making friends and influencing people. People look askance at anyone who hangs around with you voluntarily, and you’ll likely be the first name in people’s heads whenever they hear of a violent crime in the area. After all, you sure look the type.",
            "Lionhearted(hb)" : "The chivalrous champions and dashing heroes, these changelings embody all that makes up the knights in shining armor of legend. These Lost were paladins of exemplary honor or dignified chevaliers to their Fae lords and ladies. The Lionhearted shine with Gallant Splendor whilst acting with honor, allowing them to use their Presence to substitute for either Strength, Weaponry, or Brawl; replacing which ever is lowest. Their dauntless nature of the Lionhearted also grants an extra die to composure rolls to resist fear.",
            "Masterpiece(hb)" : "This fairest was a work of art, often literally sculpted by their creator, but not an inanimate thing. No, these Fairest had their flesh reshaped into an idealization of human beauty independent of cultural standards. They may not exactly fit anyone’s particular tastes, and can often be quite alien in appearance, but they will always be considered beautiful. The Masterpiece’s blessing is Ideal Form: They gain the Striking Looks Merit for free at two dots; if the Masterpiece already possesses the two-dot version, then it increases to the full four-dot version. In addition, their sexual attractiveness is universal. They do not suffer penalties to seduction attempts against targets whose personal or cultural standards, sexual orientation or preferences would normally make them incompatible.",
            "Pampered(hb)" : "Kept as pets, some lucky Changelings received doting attention from their Keepers who treasured and spoiled them before starving them of attention. These Lost often have the looks and lazy manners of felines, though coquettish, indolent concubines and sultry, sly harem slaves fit as well. The Pampered Fairest knows the subtle power of a Silken Suggestion, granting her a 1 die bonus to Manipulation rolls. In addition, once per scene, she can spend 1 glamour and roll Wyrd + Socialize + Manipulation versus a single opponent's Wyrd + Resolve + Composure. If successful, that opponent may only deal bashing damage to the Pampered for that scene, kicking and clubbing instead of stabbing or shooting. The bonus is lost of the Changeling directly attacks that opponent."

            "Bloodbrute" : "Veterans of the fighting pits frequented by jaded Gentry, the Bloodbrutes were kept for one puse only: to fight for their Keepers' enjoyment. In some cases, the battles were simple matters of survival, but too many others came with extra rules and conditions born of a fickle Other's imagination. The Bloodbrute is a master of Improvised Mayhem: By spending a Glamour point, he may rip a suitably sizable object free from its moorings and fashion it into a crude but effective weapon as a standard action. The character can create the equivalent of any weapon from the Melee Weapons Chart, given appropriate materials at hand. For example, he could craft the equivalent of a great ax by uprooting a stop sign and hastily wrapping the sign into a more effective ax head, but he couldn't make a spear out of a small nightstand. The item does not suffer any penalties for its improvised nature as long as the Bloodbrute wields it; others suffer a -1 equipment penalty if attempting to use the impromptu implement of destruction.",
            "Coegrinder" : "Some Ogres are fed upon death. The Coegrinders are survivors of massive charnel pits, brutes maintained on a diet of bones and carrion, the hulking guardians of burial grounds. They gnawed like Nidhogg at the roots of great dead trees, or tunneled into graves like ghuls to search out the freshest coes. The Coegrinder's gift is Sepulchral Hunger: The character gains a +1 bonus to any attack roll made against an enemy who has already been reduced to half his Health. In addition, the Coegrinder gains an additional die to attack rolls made against undead creatures such as vampires.",
            "Cyclopean" : "The Cyclopeans are like the ancient hunters and herdsmen of legend who sought men for their cooking pots: Changelings who resemble Cyclops of Archaic Greece, the one-legged Fachan of Scots legend, the three-eyed oni of Japan, the elephant-eared rakshas of India, or the wind-borne footless Wendigo of North America. Although many are crippled in some way, they have profound senses to make up for it. The Cyclopeans can Smell the Blood: The character gains the benefit of the 8 again rule on Wits-based Perception rolls. He can smell things that can't normally be smelled, meaning that even if some of his senses are deficient, his sense of smell makes up for it. Many Cyclopeans have Physical Flaws such as One Eye, Lame, One Arm or Hard of Hearing.",
            "Daitya" : "In Hindu myth, the Daityas are giants and ogres who opposed the gods and reviled those sacrifices given to the gods. They went to war against the heavens and, for a cycle of history, remained victorious. The kith associated with this legend is said to be composed of those Hindu Ogres who went against their Keepers -- some stories even suggest that a great battle was fought in Faerie, with a passel of Daityas bringing down a pair of callous and mighty Fae. Many Daityas are large and reptilian in features, inheriting the sent's flesh from their Keepers (who in turn plunder said flesh from the old legends of the dragon-sent Vritra, the demon who was said to have spawned the Daityas in the first place). The Daityas were apparently potent warriors who could topple pillars and cut the gods' weapons in twain with a single blow. This gives the kith the benefit of the Cutting Might: By spending a point of Glamour, the Daitya can ignore the Durability of a single object for one turn's attack, doing damage straight to the object's Structure. Moreover, the Daitya's gain a free Weaponry Specialty upon creation. [Winter Masques -- Page 109]",
            "Farwalker" : "Changelings who resemble the abominable men of mystery, the possibly savage hairy creatures of the wilds whose existence straddles the divide between folklore and cryptozoology: the Sasquatch, the yeti, the Russian Alma, the Australian yowie and dozens of other wild men. Farwalkers have The Elusive Gift: The character gains the benefit of the 9 again rule on Stealth and Survival dice pools. Also, the player can spend a point of Glamour to retake a failed Stealth or Survival roll.",
            "Gargantuan" : "Captured by giants, these changelings had to grow to a greater stature, perhaps being stretched on racks or forced to drink noxious potions. As humans, they appear less freakish, though many purchase the Giant Merit. Their blessing is Spurious Stature: Once a day, the changeling can grow to colossal size. The player spends a point of Glamour, and adds the changeling's Wyrd score to her size for the rest of the scene. This supplies temporary Health dots. Returning to normal size is painful, as if the changeling's skin is unable to contain the character's stature, and when she regains her normal height, the character takes one point of lethal damage.",
            "Gristlegrinder" : "Man-eaters and gluttons, taking their cue from the English Black Annis, Scottish Red Caps or the rakshas of India, but also sometimes resembling more modern Ogres, such as the masked unstoppable lunatics of slash-and-stalk horror movies. Every Gristlegrinder has Terrible Teeth in his terrible jaws: The character's bite is a two lethal attack, though it does require him to grapple the opponent first.",
            "Oni" : "Japanese legend speaks of the oni, vicious red-skinned ogres with hirsute bodies, horns upon their head and many eyes. The oni came to represent sin as demons, and in many stories were responsible for visiting the wicked upon their deathbeds and consuming their souls. The Oni kith visibly resemble their fairy-tale counterts, though many have skin colors other than red: Blue, jaundiced, green, black and so forth. The Oni can take advantage of many call A Mouthful of Sin: by spending one Glamour point and making a successful bite attack, the Oni consumes a number of gulps of the victim's blood equal to damage caused. Each \"gulp\" or mouthful of blood swallowed heals either one lethal point of damage or two bashing points (aggravated cannot be healed in this way). This can only be done once per chapter (game session). Curiously, this also works only when attacking a creature somehow possessed of sin -- the target must be of Morality (or its equivalent, such as Harmony, Humanity, Wisdom or Clarity) 6 or below. [Winter Masques -- Page 110]",
            "Render" : "The Renders were kept as living engines of destruction. They may have been used as shock troops in a besieging army, charged with ripping open the gates and tearing down the enemy's towers. They may have been woodsmen without axes, quarry-workers reliant on their talons rather than chisel and mattock. The Render's gift is the Sundering Talons: When damaging an object with his bare hands, the Render may ignore up to three points of Durability. His claws count as a tool created to bypass Durability",
            "Stonebones" : "Changelings who resemble the rocky giants of folklore, Nordic trolls, Native American mountain spirits and the like. The Stonebones are blessed with Obdurate Skin: Once per day as an instant action, the player can spend one point of Glamour to harden the character's skin, making it like rock. The character uses his Wyrd as his armor rating for the rest of the scene. The character's rocky carapace does mean, however, that the character isn't as nimble as he was: The changeling suffers a -1 die penalty to all Dexterity-based dice pools while this power is active. In addition, his Defense is reduced by one for every two points of Wyrd past the first; -1 Defense at 3 Wyrd, -2 Defense at 5 Wyrd and so on. This blessing doesn't stack with mundane forms of armor.",
            "Troll" : "In Nordic myths and fairy tales, trolls are certainly ogrish -- tall, featuring exaggerated and grotesque features, sharpteeth and cruel hunters. But trolls are more than that. They're not hunters, instead choosing to wait and hide in places (in barrow mounds, deep inside caverns, beneath bridges) and then trick victims with riddles and double-talk. While many trolls are strong, they're often savvy, capricious, consumed of a kind of subterranean cunning. The Troll kith gains the benefit of the Unyielding Voice: by spending a point of Glamour, the Troll can add his dots in the Strength Attribute to any Social roll involving Manipulation. [Winter Masques -- Page 110]",
            "Water-Dweller" : "Changelings who resemble the legendary water-demons of many cultures, from life-demanding river spirits through to the trolls of coastal caves and under-bridge shadows. The Water-Dweller can Lie Under the Waves: The character can hold her breath for 30 minutes, as if she had a Stamina of 7. She is also accustomed to murk and darkness, and suffers no penalties to sight-based Perception rolls when underwater.",
            "Witchtooth" : "The embodiment of the cruel, maneating hag and the selfish, mystical monster, the Witchtooth is among the wisest and most cunning of Ogres. The Witchtooth have a penchant for dark magic, particularly curses. While many of the most famous examples of this monster are female -- Baba Yaga, Spearfinger, Black Annis -- male changelings can learn the ugly secrets of Witchtooth wisdom as well. The Witchtooth has learned the secrets of the Black Hex: The character may spend Glamour to increase Occult rolls, and gains a one-die bonus to activate any Contracts that involve cursing another person (such as Fickle Fate).",
            "Bellower(hb)" : "Big, mean, and loud, these Ogres learned to use their voice as a weapon - not the fine rapier of witty debate, but the heavy hammer of an old fashioned scream. Brothers and sisters to banshees and other howling, shrieking creatures, they may have been used as messengers or alarms, or may have possibly developed their talent in order to drive away the sharp-eared monsters that stalked them. Once per scene, a Bellower may create Cacophonous Chaos by spending a point of Glamour. The Changeling shouts at the top of his lungs and causes bashing damage equal to his Wyrd to everyone in a radius equal to his Wyrd in yards, unless they make a successful Wits + Composure roll to cover their ears in time. Warning one's motley in advance is always a good idea. If the Ogre is gagged or otherwise unable to make sounds, this blessing may not be activated.",
            "Berserker(hb)" : "These ogres lived and breathed rage, becoming consumed in an uncontrollable frenzy. Either on alien battlefield or gladiatorial arenas of Faerie, these Lost lost themselves in frenzied trances that made them into a whirlwind of unstoppable violence like the warriors of legend. Worked to Reckless Abandon, berserkers enter battle with little concern for their own wellbeing, treating wound penalties as bonuses as they channel the mindless fury that was seared into their very core during their durance. Additionally berserkers gain a +1 to all stamina rolls made to stay conscious.",
            "Bloodsoaker(hb)" : "Red Caps and Washers-At-The-Ford, these gory ogres gain dark protection from bloody garments. By soaking a garment in blood and spending a point of Glamour, the changeling may invoke Sanguine Security. This gives the garment an Armour bonus equal to the number of points of Lethal damage inflicted while harvesting the blood. The blood must be fresh, harvested within a day, and the armour lasts a number of days equal to the changeling's Wyrd. A changeling may use their own blood, or the blood of another living being, but animal blood has no effect. In addition, the changeling may spend a point of glamour to clean or wash away blood in a way that leaves almost no forensic evidence, confounding any attempt at discerning whether blood was spilled at a crime scene.",
            "Sentinel(hb)" : "Lost who were forced to protect what their Keepers judged as most valuable, and put on the required muscle to scare off all manner of trespassers. Put to task as watchdogs, palace guards, and bridge trolls, these Ogres developed a unique sense of territoriality. Their Vicious Vigilance grants them a +1 bonus to all attacks against trespassers within a chosen 10 by 10 yards and a +1 bonus to notice trespassers. Once chosen, the designated area may not be changed without spending a willpower point, and may not be changed more than once a week. The storyteller is the final arbiter on what a valid area is and what is considered a trespasser."

    "Wizened": 
        {
            "Artist" : "The Wizened who create startling works of art and craft: Seamsters, sculptors, painters and builders. The Artists' blessing is Impeccable Craftsmanship: The changeling enjoys the benefit of the 8 again rule on any dice pool using Crafts, and can choose to spend a point of Glamour to re-roll any failed dice on one Crafts roll (so if, for example, an Artist who rolls five dice and gets 1, 4, 6, 8 and 9 can spend a point of Glamour and re-roll the 1, 4 and 6). This blessing can be used only once per roll.",
            "Author" : "In Faerie, these changelings composed words of all kinds for their masters, from poetry to plays to nonfiction. Authors may even have been their Keepers' only connection with mortal language, having to explain precisely what words are and how they held power. Authors still see things in terms of words -- ideal nouns and adverbs swim unasked through their minds. The Author has mastered the Polyglot's Riddle: He gains the 8 again rule to all Expression rolls dealing with writing or wordy endeavors. With a successful Wits + Academics roll, he can also deduce the meaning of written text in any mortal language.",
            "Brewer" : "Changelings who spent their durance in Faerie learning how to create mind-bendingly potent drinks or peculiar alchemies. Due to long exposure and gradual immunity, a Brewer gains four bonus dice to any Stamina roll made to resist poisons or intoxication. In addition, the Brewers know the recipe for The Inebriating Elixir: Once per scene, the changeling can instantly ferment one pint of any drink with Glamour, turning it into a powerfully intoxicating brew. The changeling needs to be able to touch the container holding the drink to do this. The changeling's player rolls Wits + Crafts. If the roll is successful, the player may spend one Glamour point to invest the drink with a Potency rating equal to the changeling's Wyrd rating, plus the number of successes the player rolled. If the Potency of the brew is higher than the Health of the person drinking the brew, the person gets very drunk, and in five turns falls unconscious. If the Potency doesn't exceed the drinker's Health, the drinker must roll Stamina + Resolve, or suffer the effects of having drunk one more drink than her Stamina. The brew's effects last for the rest of the scene.",
            "Chatelaine" : "Preternaturally skilled manservants, organizers and house-managers. The Chatelaine's talent is Perfect Protocol: The changeling gains the benefit of the 9 again rule on all Social Skill rolls which depend on manners, etiquette or proper social practice (such as in a formal ball, a business meeting or a changeling Court), even when using Presence. Further, the player can spend a point of Glamour to gain a +2 dice bonus to Manipulation and Presence dice pools for the rest of the scene.",
            "Chirurgeon" : "Changelings who master surgery and pharmacy, sometimes from altruism, and sometimes simply because they can, ranging from scary back-street surgeons to strangely alien experimenters. The Chirurgeon's blessing is The Analeptic Charm: able to perform medical miracles, the changeling gains the benefit of the 9 again rule on Medicine dice pools. The Chirurgeon can also use the humblest tools well, and never suffers from penalties for poor equipment as long as at least something can be jury-rigged as a medical tool. Finally, anyone whom the changeling tends to for any length of time receives the benefit of the Chirurgeon's skills as if they were in a hospital intensive care unit.",
            "Drudge" : "The lowest and most menial of Wizened, Drudges were given the most unpleasant tasks to perform. They suffered all the privations and modifications of their fellow Wizened, and did not even learn a faerie trade in return. Drudges are the long-suffering inheritors of house elves, domovoi and other such faeries. However, not all had their spirits broken in Arcadia, and some managed to slip away through the Thorns before their negligent Keepers noticed their absence. The Drudge was designed to provide Unseen Labor: By spending a Glamour point, the character may complete any relatively simple task in a fraction of the time, as long as no mortal watches her do so. The task cannot require more than five successes on an extended roll to complete; the Drudge could fix something simple quickly, but not repair a badly damaged car. The time required for the task is equal to the original time required divided by the character's Wyrd +1; even the weakest Drudge can cut a field or clean a house in half the time it would normally take. In addition, the Drudge gains the benefit of the 9 again rule to Stealth rolls; she is easily overlooked.",
            "Fatemaker" : "This Wizened may have skin like old parchment, with indecipherable words drifting across her papery flesh. The Fatemaker's blessing is Turn of the Tale: The changeling can, when Talecrafting, spend an additional two points of Glamour on a Talecrafting roll. Doing so ensures that, upon success, the changeling does not suffer a Cruel Twist of Fate (though such a twist will still feature in a dramatic failure no matter what).",
            "Gameplayer" : "The True Fae adore games, even if they despise the possibility of losing. Some Wizened were kept precisely to empower the Gentry's love of games. The changeling was forced to play against her Keeper, or against canny goblins and cheating imps; or she was made a part of the games, a chess piece in a game that repeated over and over again, or the queen of spades in a long poker game. She mastered many games during her durance, but cannot remember them all; some operated by rules that made no sense in Arcadia, much less in the more solid reality of the mortal world. The Gameplayer's blessing is the Grandmaster's Stratagem: By spending a Glamour point, she can win any purely mental-based game she plays (such as chess or checkers). She also gains a bonus three dice to any rolls made to gamble with games that involve a mixture of mental acuity and random chance (poker and sports betting, for instance, but not craps).",
            "Gremlin" : "Gremlins are born more of modern folktales than anything, with their first official entrance into the lore appearing during World War I. Malevolent little gremlins were said to tinker with planes, causing them to malfunction and potentially crash. Many such malfunctions were blamed on gremlins (as a joke and, for some, a very real fear), and they entered the modern canon as any kind of faerie-like creature said to disrupt the workings of machines. (Worth noting is that the term may come from the Irish Gaelic, gruaimin, meaning \"ill-humored little man.\") Wizened who assume the Gremlin kith are particularly good at damaging items temporarily with the Gremlinizing Touch: By touching a device and spending a Glamour point, the Gremlin negates any equipment bonuses associated with the device for the remainder of the scene. This applies to the damage bonuses associated with any weapon, as well (guns in particular). The character can only do this once a day. [Winter Masques -- Page 110]",
            "Pamarindo" : "Italian folklore makes fearful mention of the Pamarindo, the shriveled pot-bellied faeries with salacious appetites. Legend has them often covered in slick fats, guts, blood and greases associated with the butchering of their prey. Their appearance as a kith among the Wizened sees the Pamarindo manifesting similar physical traits: their cheeks are often smeared with red, their teeth shaand serrated, their flesh glossy and oily. The Pamarindo are foul epicures, possessing the Gourmand's Grotesquerie: By spending a Glamour point and touching a piece of raw meat (which can be as small as a single pound of flesh), the Wizened can use that meat to safely feed a number of individuals equal to his Wyrd score. This food nourishes for a full 24 hours, and no other food needs to be eaten during this time (and often can't be eaten, for one feels so full on that meal). The Pamarindo also gains the benefits of the Iron Stomach Merit if the changeling does not already possess it. [Winter Masques -- Page 110]",
            "Thusser" : "In Norway, they speak of the Thussers (known as Vardogls in Iceland) that come out of their faerie hills beneath the full moon and sing, dance, and fiddle away the night. Humans seem compelled to try to join in with the Thussers' carousing, though no mortal has ever been able to truly dance or sing with the diminutive strange-bodied creatures. The Thusser kith is similar to those wee-humans of folklore, often small and moon-eyed, and blessed, too, with the Fiddler's Delight: By spending a Glamour point and either singing or playing some manner of instrument (which does require a successful Expression roll), the Thusser can hypnotize one targeted individual. This individual cannot do anything for as long as the Thusser is able to keep up his music. The spell is only broken once the Thusser ceases the music or until the person is forced to defend himself from incoming danger. [Winter Masques -- Page 110]",
            "Inventor" : "This Wizened kith was common between the late 18th century and WWII. During this era, many amazing inventions were made by a single dedicated and often eccentric mortal, and Arcadia was filled with reflections of their dreams. As with all human imaginings and passions, the Gentry wished to have servants to create all manner of clockwork, steam-powered, or electrical wonders for them. However, eventually, mortal dreams moved on to labs and factories filled with faceless technicians, and the Gentry found other interests. Blessed (or perhaps cursed) with long, many-jointed fingers and sometimes mechanisms incorated into their own bodies, their blessing is Inventive Genius. The Inventor gains the benefit of the 8-again rule on all Crafts or Science rolls to design, build, modify, or repair any sort of device or mechanism. By spending 1 Glamour, the changeling can add dice equal to their Wyrd to any of these rolls.",
            "Miner" : "These changelings are the knockers and kobolds, the Coblynau and Telchines. Miners labored in deep mines to extract rare and precious metals, and perhaps other things -- chipping out veins of fossilized blood from the rotting gut of a mountain-sized great beast, or tunneling for the root of all evil. The Miner's gift is the Tappingspeak: By spending one Glamour, the changeling may tap out a coded message on a nearby surface. The message (which cannot be longer than three sentences) travels like vibrations to the intended recipient, as long as there's a sufficient medium between the two to carry it all the distance (thus, a recipient currently in an aiane could not receive the missive). The range is one mile per point of the Miner's Wyrd. The recipient automatically understands the meaning of the Tappingspeak, thanks to the Glamour embedded in the message.",
            "Oracle" : "Changelings who, like many imps and goblins, can, in a limited way, see the future. The Oracle's blessing is Panomancy: The changeling can, once per chapter, tell fortunes using any method she wants -- tea-leaves, cards, bones, a crystal ball or anything else. The effect works the same as the Common Sense Merit (although the character can buy the Merit as well, if the player wishes).",
            "Smith" : "Changelings who were forced to labor under the watchful eye of the most unimpeachable Faerie blacksmiths, tinkers and toolmakers. Their blessing is Steel Mastery: The changeling can use his supernatural skill with metallurgy to alter metal objects, improving them, even if improving them would normally be impossible. The player spends one Glamour and makes an extended roll of Dexterity + Crafts, with each roll representing half an hour of tinkering, polishing and hammering. If the changeling manages to gather four successes, he can alter a tool so that it gives a +1 equipment bonus. The item has to mostly be made of metal. The magic wears off after a day. No object this way can be improved more than three times. If the changeling tries to alter an object a fourth time, he destroys the tool, and it can never be used again.",
            "Soldier" : "Members of the vast goblin hosts of the Fae, the Soldiers fought strange, inconclusive battles and now find that fighting comes easier to them. The Soldiers' talent is Blade Lore: Living and breathing the lore of the blade, the Soldiers of the goblin hosts find it easy to master any weapon that carries an edge. A Soldier is considered to have a Weaponry specialization with any weapon that carries an edge, no matter what it is. This can't stack with other specializations the changeling may learn.",
            "Woodwalker" : "The Wizened who, like their captors, live within and protect the wilds, sometimes jealously, sometimes violently. Their talent is Wildcraft: the changeling gets the benefit of the 8 again rule on Survival rolls. Also, the Woodwalker can survive by eating any plant, no matter how poisonous (although poisons that are isolated and distilled from plant sources are still dangerous to him, because they're not strictly plant matter any more).",
            "Barrister(hb)" : "Arcadia runs on rules and laws, though these esoteric systems are created from whole cloth and known only to the True Fae. An inkling of this knowledge flows into these Changelings, who navigate the bizarre legalities of life in and beyond the Hedge with inhuman aplomb. Only by knowing and exploiting the rules could they survive. Once per story, a Barrister can spend a glamour and voice their OBJECTION! to reality itself, invoking a tiny portion of the True Fae's ability to create their own laws. This forces a re-roll on any action. The second roll must be accepted. On top of this, Barristers enjoy the 9 again rule on rolls involving Politics and Expression.",
            "Chaffeur(hb)" : "Tasked with the safe transport of their Fae masters throughout the wild terrain of Arcadia, the Chauffeurs learned to handle all manner of vehicles with aplomb lest the whips be turned on them next. Whether guiding a team of wild fae horses, piloting an impossible clockwork watercraft, or soaring through storm-tossed skies in fantastic balloon, these Wizened always arrive safely and on time. When behind the controls of a vehicle, they can Take the Reins and re-roll any failed Drive check by spending a point of glamour. On top of this, they receive a free Drive specialty in their chosen mode of locomotion and may add their Wyrd to their initiative when driving.",
            "Gourmand(hb)" : "No mere kitchen slaves, these Lost learned to work culinary magic with strange goblin fruits, vegetables, meats, and spices - all to please their demanding Masters. Those who failed became the next course. Gourmands enjoy a Wyrd/2, rounded up, die bonus to all Craft rolls involving cooking and all Intelligence rolls to identify edibles, and may bestow the Epicurean Benefaction by spending a point of glamour while preparing a single serving of food. This glamour is stored in the food and may be later consumed - by anyone - to recover the glamour point. If the food goes bad or is otherwise rendered inedible or unpalatable, the glamour is lost.",
            "Huckster(hb)" : "Everything has a price, and that goes doubly so in the lands beyond the Thorns. Some Changelings discover a talent for bartering, buying, and more importantly, selling during their time in Arcadia. They may have worked the goblin markets at their Master's behest, managed the appraisal and purchase of slaves, or just bargained every sunrise for another day of life. Their gift is the Gilded Tongue, which grants them the Market Sense (Rites of Spring, p. 94) merit for free. In addition to this, they may apply the +3 bonus for recognizing a bad deal from Market Sense to trades done outside of Goblin Markets by spending a glamour per trade. Finally, they may also spend a glamour to apply the +3 bonus when convincing a mortal into an unfair trade, as mortals were meant to be the dupes of the Fae.",
            "Jester(hb)" : "These Lost learned the twisted intricacies and bizarre forms of Faerie humor during their durance. Whether these wizened served their keepers as fools for Arcadian courts or as stand-up comics in a Gentry nightclub they posses a talent for making people laugh, granting them a free specialty in expression provided it falls with in their purview. Jesters may undertake the Fool's Gambit, by spending 1 Glamour and rolling Expression + Wyrd - the subject's Composure, the changeling may make a scathing joke out of the subject, inflicting a -2 penalty to a skill of the changeling's choice. The Jester may deliver a number of these cutting remarks equal to their Wyrd per scene.",
            "Scrounger(hb)" : "Living in the nooks and crannies of their Keepers realms, these Lost learned to collect and scavenge off the scraps of their Faerie masters or were sent to scour away odds and ends and knick-knacks at their Lord's behest. Honed from their time sifting through the oddest piles of junk these mischievous changelings possess the Blessing of the Missing Keys, granting them the uncanny ability to find things hidden in cracks and clutter. Once per scene, the changeling may spend Glamour on a 1 to 1 basis to add to dice pools to scrounge, scavenge, forage, or otherwise locate items stashed away. Additionally the scrounger gains a free specialty in Survival."
